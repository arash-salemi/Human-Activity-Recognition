# Human-Activity-Recognition

Employed a number of machine learning algorithms, including DNN, GRU, and bidirectional GRU, to classify human activities such as walking, sitting, etc.

- Dimension reduction and pre-processing of IMU data collected via a smartphone
- Employed DNN, GRU, and bidirectional GRU to classify human activities, such as walking, sitting, etc.
- Optimized network hyperparameters (learning rate, neuron numbers, etc.) using Grid Search and GA
